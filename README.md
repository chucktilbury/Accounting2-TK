# Accounting2-TK
Simple accounting package implemented in Python3 and Tkinter.

This is a simple accounting package that can import transactions directly from a PayPal CSV file. This allows the accounts to be tracked with a minimum of effort.

Double entry accounting strategy is used. My accounting needs are very simple. This software reflects that fact.
